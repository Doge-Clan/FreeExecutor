# FreeExecutor
This is the source code for a JavaScript web-based shell. It can be embedded in an HTML5 page, or can be used as a bookmarklet to run over any website you desire.

## Bookmarklet Source Code
Bookmarklet Code was temporarly removed due to it lagging and being ugly rendered. (Full release of 0.4 will add it back, if you still want FreeExecutor, copy it from the source of 0.3!)

## How to Use
Currently to see all commands, run `fepkg --list-commands` to see all currently installed commands.

## Limitations
- No Cross-Origin Scripts (Cross-Website Storage can be done but that may take a bit)
- Some Websites fail to Execute because of strict security policies (Ex: Google Classroom)
- Text UI is not fully done and prompt/alert are still used and not patched (Full Release of 0.4 will fix `prompt()`)
