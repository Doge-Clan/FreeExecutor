## Bookmarklet Source Code
Not Ready Yet for production. Please use 0.2.1 if you need something that works now.

## How to Use
Currently to see all commands, run `fepkg --list-commands` to see all currently installed commands.

## Limitations
- No Cross-Origin Scripts
- No persistant packages akin to libnix of 0.2.1 (This will be added by 0.3 full release)
- Limitations that websites enforce still exist.
